# Prime Generation in Rust

At a glance, the crate is an implementation of various prime generation methods in Rust. It is split into two parts, the library which exposes a simple interface for generating primes, and the CLI application which acts as an example use case of the library.

However, the meaning behind the name of this Rust crate is a double entendre. The name also implies that I have used the development of this crate to learn and understand the intricacies of developing a Rust crate.

## Build

Currently this crate depends on Rust nightly features in order to be built.
